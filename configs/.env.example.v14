# Technitium-Sync Environment Configuration
# Example for Technitium DNS v14.0+ (Clustering Enabled)
#
# In v14.0+, when clustering is enabled:
# - All nodes share the same admin token (synced by the Primary node)
# - Only the Primary node can be modified (Secondary nodes are read-only replicas)
# - Zone transfers and config sync happen automatically within the cluster
# - The app detects cluster state and enables cluster-aware features

# Backend HTTPS Configuration
HTTPS_ENABLED=true
HTTPS_PORT=3443
HTTPS_CERT_PATH=/app/certs/fullchain.cer
HTTPS_KEY_PATH=/app/certs/*.yourdomain.arpa.key
HTTPS_CA_PATH=/app/certs/ca.cer

# Comma-separated list of node IDs
# These should match your cluster node names
TECHNITIUM_NODES=primary,secondary1,secondary2

# Cluster-wide admin token (shared by all nodes)
# In v14.0+ clusters, this token is automatically synced to all nodes
TECHNITIUM_CLUSTER_TOKEN=shared-cluster-admin-token

# Primary Node Configuration
# This is the Primary node in your Technitium cluster
TECHNITIUM_PRIMARY_NAME="Primary DNS"
TECHNITIUM_PRIMARY_BASE_URL=https://primary.yourdomain.arpa:53443

# Secondary Node 1 Configuration
# This is a Secondary (replica) node in your cluster
TECHNITIUM_SECONDARY1_NAME="Secondary DNS 1"
TECHNITIUM_SECONDARY1_BASE_URL=https://secondary1.yourdomain.arpa:53443

# Secondary Node 2 Configuration
# This is another Secondary (replica) node in your cluster
TECHNITIUM_SECONDARY2_NAME="Secondary DNS 2"
TECHNITIUM_SECONDARY2_BASE_URL=https://secondary2.yourdomain.arpa:53443

# Frontend API URL (production)
# VITE_API_URL=https://yourserver.yourdomain.arpa:3443

# Important Notes for v14.0+ Clustering:
# - All nodes MUST use the same admin token (synced by Technitium automatically)
# - Use TECHNITIUM_CLUSTER_TOKEN for clustered setups (recommended)
# - Only the Primary node can be modified (write operations)
# - Secondary nodes are read-only replicas
# - The Sync tab is hidden when clustering is enabled (not needed)
# - Cluster role changes are automatically detected every 30 seconds
# - Write pages (DNS Filtering and DHCP) auto-select the Primary node
