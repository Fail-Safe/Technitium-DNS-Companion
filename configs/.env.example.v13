# Technitium-Sync Environment Configuration
# Example for Technitium DNS v13.6 and earlier (No Clustering)
#
# In v13.6, each node has its own independent admin token.
# There is no clustering support, so each node operates independently.

# Backend HTTPS Configuration
HTTPS_ENABLED=true
HTTPS_PORT=3443
HTTPS_CERT_PATH=/app/certs/fullchain.cer
HTTPS_KEY_PATH=/app/certs/*.yourdomain.com.key
HTTPS_CA_PATH=/app/certs/ca.cer

# Comma-separated list of node IDs
# You can have 2+ nodes for redundancy, but they won't be in a cluster
TECHNITIUM_NODES=node1,node2,node3

# Node 1 Configuration (Primary DNS Server)
TECHNITIUM_NODE1_NAME="Node 1"
TECHNITIUM_NODE1_BASE_URL=https://dns1.yourdomain.com:5380
TECHNITIUM_NODE1_TOKEN=unique-admin-token-for-node1

# Node 2 Configuration (Secondary DNS Server)
TECHNITIUM_NODE2_NAME="Node 2"
TECHNITIUM_NODE2_BASE_URL=https://dns2.yourdomain.com:5380
TECHNITIUM_NODE2_TOKEN=unique-admin-token-for-node2

# Node 3 Configuration (Tertiary DNS Server)
TECHNITIUM_NODE3_NAME="Node 3"
TECHNITIUM_NODE3_BASE_URL=https://dns3.yourdomain.com:5380
TECHNITIUM_NODE3_TOKEN=unique-admin-token-for-node3

# Frontend API URL (production)
# VITE_API_URL=https://yourserver.yourdomain.com:3443

# Important Notes for v13.6:
# - Each node must have a unique admin token
# - No clustering features available (Sync tab will be hidden)
# - You must manually keep zones/settings in sync across nodes
# - All nodes will show as "Standalone" in the UI
